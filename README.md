# FuturesLab
App for creating spreads from Future contracts, Linux MX, developed on C++ 17

execute compile.sh as a bash script to run the conosle application.

Around 2017 I started trading, after approximately 18 month I encoutered algorithmic trading and learned how to code in C++ to 
develop a trading app, where I could reformat excel files of Futures (commodoty contracts) data into spreads ( difference in price
of two commodities).
Since this was my first coding project, The code is absolutely terrible, even to use everything of the app one must set,
the correct path in the source code, at that time I inteded to use it only for my own.

No garantuee that the app actually does correctly what it is supposed to do, it was not thoutoughly tested.
